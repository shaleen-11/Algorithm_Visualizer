      <h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
        Sorting algorithms are ubiquitous in computer science. This webpage provides a visual demonstration of some
        popular sorting algorithms.

    <h3>Visualization</h3>

    <p>
      The height of the candles represents their numerical value. Initially, the candles are randomly distributed. You
      can use various sorting algorithms to put them in ascending order. Sorted sections of the list are shown in blue,
      whereas unsorted sections are shown in red. In divide-and-conquer algorithms like quick sort and merge sort,
      sections of the list being ignored are colored gray. White candles convey that the iterator is at their position.
      Yellow candles are used to depict candles of interest, eg: the maximum number encountered <em>so far</em> during
      selection sort. In quick sort, the pivot candle is colored purple (and is placed at the end of the list).

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Bubble sort:</b> A simple sorting algorithm that just goes through the list comparing adjacent elements and
        swapping them if they are not in order. It's performance and utility are very poor, and is primarily taught for
        educational purposes. It has an average time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>). However, if the machine performing
        the sort has a sizeable probability of not comparing elements properly, then bubble sort is the most fault
        tolerant algorithm in this list (since it makes frequent comparisons, and can detect mistakes made previously).
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Selection sort:</b> Another simple sorting algorithm. It scans all N elements, finds the largest one, and puts
        it at the Nth position. Then, it scans all N-1 elements, finds the largest one, puts it at the (N-1)th position,
        and so on. It is as bad as bubble sort, with an average time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>). It doesn't use the
        advantages of an approximately sorted list. However, it is noted for its simplicity.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Insertion sort:</b> An algorithm that most humans likely use unconsciously to sort things. It considers the
        first k elements to be sorted, and figures out where the (k+1)th element should be placed within the sorted
        portion. Although its time complexity is still O(n<sup>2</sup>), insertion sort has significant advantages over
        the last two. It is extremely good for sorting lists that are already approximately sorted, nearing a time
        complexity of O(n) in this case. Even if a list is already sorted, it can readily accept another element and put
        it in its correct place.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Cocktail Shaker sort:</b> A variation of selection sort that scans for the maximum element while going forward,
        and the minimum element while going backward. It is useful for electromechanical machines that use a physical
        data reader to scan and sort through values stored on a tape.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Heap sort:</b> A slightly complex sorting algorithm that uses a data structure called heaps. First algorithm on
        this list to have a time complexity of O(n log n), although it comes with a space complexity of O(n), and the only
        algorithm on this list to require explicit space. It is extremely good at keeping frequently updated lists sorted
        dynamically, an advantage conferred by the data structure that it is built on. For information on the heap data
        structure, please refer to the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-data-structure/"
          target="_blank">GeeksForGeeks</a> website.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Quick sort:</b> As the name implies, it has the fastest time complexity of O(n log n) despite not requiring any
        explicit memory. It randomly chooses an element as a pivot, and transports all elements lower than the pivot to the
        left, and the elements greater than the pivot to the right of the pivot. The same operation is repeated on the
        portion of the list to the left and right of the pivot, recursively. Despite its charismatic name, it is
        difficult to implement, and certain choices of pivots can be disastrous for its runtime.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Merge sort:</b> The industrial standard for sorting huge lists. It recursively divides the list into smaller
        lists, sorts the smaller ones, and merges them in the right way. It always has a time complexity of O(n log n). A
        merge sort routine with multithreading support can sort billions of numbers in no time. However, it uses some
        auxiliary memory while merging, and is really difficult to implement.
      </li>
    </ol>
